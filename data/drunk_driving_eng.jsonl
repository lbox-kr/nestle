Despite this, on January 4, 2020, at around 15:40, the defendant drove a vehicle model E cargo truck while intoxicated with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.140% from the road in front of the B market in Muan County, Jeollanam-do, to the road in front of the D car wash in C, covering a distance of approximately 100 meters.\nThereby, the defendant violated the obligation to refrain from driving while drunk, on more than two occasions.\n\nReasons for Sentencing\nThe gravity of the crime is not light, as the defendant has committed the same type of crime multiple times despite previous punishments. Therefore, a sentence of imprisonment is warranted. However, considering there have been no criminal convictions since the punishment around the year 2010, the distance of the drunk driving, the circumstances of being apprehended, as well as taking into account the defendant's age, character, family environment, and all other relevant circumstances, the execution of the sentence is suspended this time."}

Drunk driving endangers the lives and well-being of innocent people, and can completely shatter the peace of a family; considering the social danger and harm it causes, strict punishment is necessary. In response to societal demands to eradicate the harm caused by drunk driving, the current Road Traffic Act has significantly strengthened the penalties and enforcement standards.

The alcohol concentration during this instance of drunk driving was high, and the distance driven was very long.

On December 3, 2012, at the Goyang Branch of the same court, the defendant received another summary order to pay a fine of KRW 6,000,000 for the same violation. On March 30, 2016, at the Goyang Branch of the Uijeongbu District Court, the defendant was sentenced to six months in prison with a two-year suspended sentence for the same offense. On June 7, 2018, at the Goyang Branch of the Uijeongbu District Court, the defendant was sentenced to one year and ten months in prison for the same offense, serving time in the Uijeongbu Prison until being released on parole on May 10, 2019, and completing the parole period on July 17, 2019.\nOn July 26, 2020, at around 08:00 AM, the defendant drove a F K5 sedan while intoxicated with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.195% from the parking lot of 'C Restaurant' in Ilsandong District, Goyang City to the road in front of 'E Restaurant' in the same district, over approximately 200 meters.\nThus, the defendant has violated the regulation prohibiting drunk driving more than twice.\n\nReasons for Sentencing\nIn response to demands to strengthen the punishment for drunk driving offenses, the amended Road Traffic Act of December 24, 2018, has intensified the penalties for those who have driven under the influence of alcohol more than twice, by setting a prison sentence of not less than two years and not more than five years (even after mitigation, not less than one year and not more than two years and six months). Considering that the defendant has been punished four times for drunk driving as stated in the crime facts above, and that the defendant committed the current offense of drunk driving again during the repeat offense period, and the blood alcohol concentration was very high at 0.195%, the imposition of an actual prison sentence is inevitable.\nHowever, considering that the defendant admits to their wrongdoing and that the distance driven was relatively short, the sentence is determined within the range of mitigation as stated above."}

The degree of inherent risk in this case of drunk driving is not light, considering the defendant was reported to the police via 112 emergency call and apprehended for swerving across lanes while driving intoxicated. The blood alcohol concentration in this case was high, at 0.158%.

The voice of our society demanding strong punishment for such acts is growing louder day by day. The defendant has previously been punished for causing bodily harm to a person in a traffic accident while driving under the influence. However, the defendant again committed drunk driving without realizing its dangers, causing a serious threat to the safety of the general public. During this incident of drunk driving, the defendant caused a traffic accident by veering onto a sidewalk, nearly causing significant harm to human life. Considering the blood alcohol concentration level at the time, it appears that the defendant's alcohol intake was substantial.\nNonetheless, mitigating factors such as the defendant's admission of wrongdoing and remorseful attitude are taken into consideration, as is the fortunate absence of pedestrians on the sidewalk when the defendant veered off the road, preventing the risk caused by the defendant from materializing into actual harm to the lives or bodies of third parties.\nIn addition, other factors such as the defendant's age, character and environment, motive, means and consequences of the offense, and the circumstances after the offense as revealed during the trial proceedings have been taken into account in determining the sentence as ordered above."}

However, it was also considered that the defendant admits their wrongdoing and shows sincere remorse, the level of alcohol in their blood at the time of the incident was not relatively high, the distance driven while under the influence was not particularly long, there is no previous record of criminal punishment exceeding a fine for drunk driving, and the defendant is the sole provider for their elderly mother. These factors are deemed favorable to the defendant.

Hence, despite previously violating the provision prohibiting drunk driving under the Road Traffic Act, the defendant again drove under the influence of alcohol.\n\nReasons for the Sentencing\nConsidering the risk of accidents and the potential harm to innocent victims caused by drunk driving in the current traffic conditions, which are frequented by an unspecified number of people, there is a significant social need to firmly deal with drunk driving. The legislation prescribes a statutory penalty of imprisonment for not less than two years and not more than five years, or a fine between KRW 10,000,000 and KRW 20,000,000 for anyone who commits drunk driving more than twice, reflecting this legislative intent. The defendant is greatly to be blamed for repeating the offense of drunk driving while heavily intoxicated despite having a previous conviction for the same offense.\nHowever, considering the defendant's deep remorse for the crime, the circumstances before and after the offense, the defendant's age, family environment, and other relevant sentencing conditions, the court, in this case, has decided to particularly consider and apply a mitigated sentence within the permitted range, thereby suspending the execution of the sentence and ordering community service and mandatory attendance at law-abiding driving classes, as specified above."}

Considering the sentencing hearing conducted by this court, it appears that the defendant drove the aforementioned company-provided truck used by four electricians working with him at the Andong site, who took turns driving the vehicle on a rotational basis; the defendant could have handed over the driving duties to another employee had he felt any intoxication. Nevertheless, the defendant, unaware of any intoxication, took the wheel. It was found that the defendant, after worrying about the means of livelihood the previous night at home, drank two cans of beer and then took medication for chronic conditions (cerebral infarction and sinusitis) the following morning, which included Styren tablets that contain an alcohol ingredient. Therefore, it cannot be entirely ruled out that the alcohol contained in the medication could have affected the blood alcohol concentration; yet the defendant fully accepted the measured value and showed deep remorse. Furthermore, considering that there has been no record of drunk driving for 13 years since 2007, it is deemed appropriate to evaluate the culpability of the indicated offense as low and therefore impose the minimum statutory fine possible, after mitigating the punishment. Additionally, taking into account the defendant's economic hardship which has been exacerbated by the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the availability of construction work, as well as the defendant's age and family circumstances, the execution of the fine is suspended. However, probation is imposed to ensure the effective prevention of reoffending.\nFor these reasons, the judgment is rendered as ordered above."}

Based on the fact that this was done during the daytime when surveillance is less frequent, and that the blood alcohol level far exceeded the criteria for license revocation, the culpability of the defendant is not light, therefore a severe warning is necessary, which led to the choice of an imprisonment sentence. However, considering that the defendant has no previous punishment of imprisonment or more severe penalties, has had no similar offenses in the past 12 years since 2007, is deeply repentant, and taking into account the defendant's age and occupation, the sentence will be suspended. In order to prevent re-offending, strict supervision by a probation officer, as well as systematic education about safety and defensive driving, is deemed beneficial, which is why orders for probation supervision and mandatory attendance at lawful driving lectures are imposed.\nFor the reasons stated above, the judgment is as decreed."}

Particularly, the defendant was previously sentenced on November 22, 2018, to one year in prison with a three-year probation, yet violated the terms of probation by committing another drunk driving offense. It is judged that sentencing the defendant to a fine or probation would not have a corrective effect. Therefore, an actual prison term is imposed on the defendant.\n\nHowever, various circumstances are considered in the sentencing, such as: the defendant's blood alcohol level being 0.058%, which is not extremely high; the defendant has dependent family members; the defendant appears to have been returning home after drinking alcohol while doing seasonal work in the mountains; the defendant shows a repentant attitude by acknowledging the wrongdoing; the defendant is undergoing treatment for diabetes. These factors are taken into account in determining the sentence, along with the defendant's age, character, family relationship, and other sentencing conditions revealed from the case records and trial proceedings. The sentence for the defendant is thus decided as ordered."}

The defendant is also ordered to perform 80 hours of community service.\n\nFacts\nOn February 9, 2019, around 00:32, the defendant drove a Grandeur C sedan while under the influence of alcohol, with a blood alcohol concentration between 0.05% and less than 0.092%, over a distance of approximately 20 meters near the rear gate of B Apartment in Jangan-gu, Suwon.\n\nReasons for Sentencing\nDespite having been punished with fines for drunk driving in 2002 and 2008, the defendant committed the same act again, raising concerns about the risk of reoffending. However, the court takes into consideration the defendant's admission of the facts and remorseful attitude regarding the guilty distance driven (20m), the absence of other penalties apart from the two aforementioned drunk driving records, the fact that no personal or property damage occurred, and the short distance of the drive for which the defendant has been found guilty. Furthermore, considering the defendant's age, behavior, career, environment, circumstances and outcomes of the offense, and other aspects of the situation after the offense as revealed in the records of this case and during the trial, the court has determined the sentence as stated in the ruling.\n\nPart on Acquittal\n1. Summary of the Prosecution's Case\nThe defendant is accused of having driven the aforementioned vehicle, under the influence with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.092%, from a road near H in Gwonseon-gu, Suwon, to the vicinity of the rear gate of B Apartment in Jangan-gu, Suwon, a distance of approximately 3 km, between around 00:20 and 00:33 on February 9, 2019.\n2. Judgment\na. Concerning driving time and distance\nThe evidence presented by the prosecutor is insufficient to prove beyond the recognized guilty driving time and distance that the defendant drove the said vehicle over the approximately 3 km section mentioned above between the stated times on February 9, 2019.\nb. Regarding the rising stage argument\n1) In a situation where it is uncertain whether the drunk driving occurred during the rising or falling stage of blood alcohol concentration, if the measure at the time of arrest, which occurred well after driving had ceased, exceeds the legal limit only slightly, one cannot conclusively determine that the actual blood alcohol concentration at the time of driving exceeded the legal limit. It is generally known that blood alcohol concentration typically peaks between 30 and 90 minutes after consumption and thereafter decreases at a rate of about 0.008% to 0.03% (average about 0.015%) per hour. If the end of driving occurs during the rising stage, the actual blood alcohol concentration at the time of driving could be lower than the measured value.\nHowever, even if there is a time gap between the moment of driving and the measurement of blood alcohol concentration, and the latter appears to fall within the rising phase, this alone does not make it impossible to prove that the actual blood alcohol concentration at the time of driving exceeded the legal limit. In such cases, whether it is reasonable to conclude that the blood alcohol concentration at the time of driving exceeded the legal limit should be determined rationally based on logical and empirical rules after considering factors such as the time interval between driving and measurement, the difference between the measured blood alcohol concentration and the legal limit, the duration and amount of alcohol consumption, the driver's behavior at the time of enforcement and measurement, and if there was a traffic accident, the circumstances and details surrounding it (refer to the Supreme Court's decision 2013Do6285, October 24, 2013).\n2) The defendant's stated end of driving in the indictment is around 00:33 on February 9, 2019, and the measured breath alcohol concentration was 0.092%. However, based on the defendant's latest drinking time (around 23:50 on February 8, 2019) and enforcement time (between roughly 01:14 and 01:17 on February 9, 2019), there is a possibility that the defendant was in the rising stage of blood alcohol concentration both at the time of enforcement and at the time of breath measurement. There is an interval of at least 40 minutes between the last driving time and the breath measurement. Officer D, who conducted the enforcement, testified that although the defendant smelled like alcohol, the defendant communicated sufficiently and clearly. Considering these factors, it is difficult to conclusively prove from the presented evidence alone that the defendant drove with a breath alcohol concentration of 0.092% at the last time of driving, and there is no other evidence to affirm this.\nc. Therefore, due to the lack of evidence to prove the offense in this part of the prosecution's case, the defendant is acquitted according to the latter part of Article 325 of the Criminal Procedure Code. However, separate mention of acquittal is omitted in the ruling, as the violation of the Road Traffic Act (drunk driving) adjudged in this decision is already recognized as guilty."}

{"doc_id": "4658", "text": "Case Title\nViolation of the Road Traffic Law (Driving Under the Influence)\n\nSentence\nThe defendant is sentenced to imprisonment for one year and four months.\n\nFacts\nThe defendant, on December 29, 2002, drove a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.147% and received a summary order to pay a fine of one million won for violating the Road Traffic Law (driving under the influence) by the Tongyeong Branch of the Changwon District Court on March 7, 2003. On November 12, 2006, with a BAC of 0.098%, the defendant again drove while intoxicated and received a summary order from the same court for the same offense, this time to pay a fine of 1.5 million won on December 7, 2006. Further, on January 21, 2010, with a BAC of 0.139%, the defendant once more operated a vehicle while drunk and was issued a summary order by the same court for the same crime to pay a fine of 2.5 million won on February 22, 2010. Additionally, on April 25, 2016, with a BAC of 0.171%, the defendant drove while intoxicated and was sentenced on August 11, 2016, by the same court to six months in prison with a two-year suspended sentence. During the probation period, on September 4, 2017, the defendant was found driving under the influence again with a BAC of 0.117%. Consequently, the defendant was sentenced to eight months in prison by the same court for the same crime on November 17, 2017, and the judgment became final on February 27, 2018, thereby invalidating the previously suspended sentence. While serving the prison sentence, the defendant was released on parole on September 28, 2018, and the parole period elapsed on December 18, 2018.\nOn May 28, 2021, around 07:40, in a state of intoxication with a BAC of 0.156%, the defendant drove a Santa Fe passenger car (license plate number omitted) for approximately 1.5 km from the road in front of B in Okcheon County, Chungbuk, to the road in front of D in C.\nTherefore, the defendant has violated Article 44, Section 1 of the Road Traffic Law more than twice.\n\nReasons for Sentencing\nDrunk driving increases the risk of traffic accidents, which not only threatens the lives and safety of the drivers themselves but also that of other people, and with the rise of social damage caused by drunk driving, it is necessary to hold DUI offenders severely accountable. The defendant has repeatedly committed DUI offenses, been punished with fines three times, and then received a suspended prison sentence, only to commit the crime yet again and receive an actual prison term, resulting in the suspension being revoked and consequently being punished twice with actual imprisonment. The defendant's responsibility is significant due to committing the current offense during the repeat offending period for the same type of crime and even causing a traffic accident in this case. The defendant's drink driving blameworthiness is extremely high. Although it appears that the defendant drove after sleeping off the initial intoxication, the BAC at the time of the offense was still high, therefore, the hazardous nature of the so-called hangover driving cannot be considered low.\nHowever, the defendant acknowledges and has shown remorse for his actions. The traffic accident caused by the defendant resulted in only minor damage to another vehicle. The defendant appeals for leniency citing obligations such as paying alimony for a minor child being cared for by a divorced spouse. After the detection of the current offense, the defendant promised not to drink and drive again and engaged in alcohol addiction counseling, subsequently transferring ownership of the vehicle to someone else.\nNevertheless, even considering all the favorable circumstances claimed by the defendant, it is necessary to impose a corresponding imprisonment sentence on the defendant who has failed to take the repeated punishments for drunk driving seriously and has committed the present crime. In addition, considering all circumstances that factor into sentencing, such as the defendant's age, behavior, environment, motive and circumstances of the offense, and post-offense behavior, the sentence is determined as described in the sentence above."}

The potential for blame and risk of recidivism are significant. Drunk driving is a grave crime that can take the lives of not only the driver but also innocent people, and considering that the amended Road Traffic Act has increased statutory penalties to strengthen criminal punishment, it is necessary to impose corresponding criminal responsibility on the defendant who shows contempt for the rule of law and is at high risk of reoffending.\nTaking into account various circumstances that are favorable or unfavorable to the defendant, as well as the defendant's age, environment, motives, means and consequences of the crime, and post-crime circumstances, as revealed during the trial, the sentence has been determined in consideration of these various factors."}

Considering that the defendant's blood alcohol concentration far exceeded the license revocation threshold and that it appears the defendant has chosen late-night hours for driving in anticipation of less frequent checkpoints, the defendant's culpability is not light, and there is a serious concern for the risk of reoffending, thus necessitating a severe warning thereby choosing an imprisonment sentence. However, considering that the defendant has no criminal record of imprisonment or more severe penalties, and taking into account the defendant's age, occupation, and family relationships, the execution of the sentence is suspended, with the assessment that stricter management and supervision by a probation officer might help prevent reoffending.

Although the defendant sold the vehicle after the incident, the buyer appears to be the defendant’s son, which raises some doubt as to whether the sale of the vehicle truly reflects a genuine intent to avoid reoffending.\nHowever, considering that all of the defendant's past same-type offenses resulted in fines, and the last one was in 2009 – more than ten years ago – along with the defendant’s blood alcohol content being 0.056%, which is not very high, and the apparent strong social ties exhibited by the defendant’s acquaintances pleading for leniency; taking these factors into account, as well as the defendant's age, character, environment, motives, means, and consequences of the offense, and the circumstances after the offense as shown in the arguments and records of this case, the sentence is determined accordingly, suspending the execution of the sentence this time as ordered above."}

Thus, the defendant drove a motor vehicle while intoxicated on more than two occasions.\n\n[Case Number: 2021고단2983]\n<Criminal Record>\nThe defendant was ordered to pay a fine of 1 million won for a violation of the Road Traffic Act (drunk driving) by the Suwon District Court on June 14, 2017, and was subsequently indicted without detention for a violation of the Road Traffic Act (drunk driving) by the same court on May 20, 2021, with the first trial still in progress.\n\n<Criminal Facts>\nOn May 22, 2021, at approximately 02:06 AM, the defendant drove a Rexton Sports vehicle, registration number omitted, while under the influence of alcohol with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.233%, on the road in front of the G restaurant in Hwaseong City F to the road in front of 'I' in H, covering a distance of approximately 400 meters. As a result, the defendant violated the regulations prohibiting drunk driving on more than two occasions.\n\nReasons for Sentencing\nDrunk driving is a serious crime that can harm not only the driver but also the lives and bodies of an unspecified number of others. The defendant has a recent criminal record of being punished for drunk driving in 2017 and committed another act of drunk driving on February 6, 2021, despite being on probation for a different type of crime at that time. Furthermore, the defendant committed yet another act of drunk driving shortly after charges were filed against him on May 22, 2021, contributing to the gravity of the offense. Given that the blood alcohol content at the time of each drunk driving incident exceeded 0.2% and was quite high, and considering the occurrence of traffic accidents, the risk posed during the time of the drunk driving was also deemed to be very high.\n\nHowever, consider the defendant's admission and remorse for the crimes committed, note that the prior suspended prison sentence concerned a different type of crime, and recognize that aside from one instance of a fine in 2017, there is no record of punishment for a similar offense. Furthermore, taking into account the defendant's age, conduct, environment, circumstances before and after the offense, and other sentencing conditions revealed during the trial, the sentence is determined as described in the disposition."}

Particularly noteworthy is the occurrence of this offense after the defendant received a suspended prison sentence in 2017, during the probationary period of which the defendant attended mandatory safe driving lectures, yet has relapsed into committing the same crime again after a few years.

Nevertheless, considering that the defendant has admitted to and shown remorse for the current offense, favorable circumstances such as the blood alcohol concentration, the temporal gap from previous DUI offenses, the motive and details surrounding the offense, the method and outcome of the crime, the defendant's circumstances after the offense, and the overall sentencing conditions including the defendant's age, environment, and criminal history, the sentence is determined as ordered above."}

Considering that the defendant has a prior record of punishment for drunk driving and yet committed the same crime again, and given the relatively high blood alcohol concentration, the seriousness of the crime is not light.\nHowever, the order of sentencing is decided by taking into account the following: the defendant acknowledges the crime, shows remorse for the wrongdoing, has made promises not to re-offend by taking actions such as selling the vehicle, has no other criminal record except for the previous drunk driving offense, and various other circumstances that serve as conditions for sentencing, including the defendant's age, character, environment, motives and circumstances of the offense, means and consequences, and post-offense behavior as recorded in the case file."}

During the suspended sentence period, the defendant received a four-month prison sentence for obstruction of business, among other charges, by the Chuncheon District Court on October 6, 2016, and that judgment became final on December 13, 2016, which led to the suspension being revoked. The defendant completed the execution of this sentence on January 1, 2019, at the Wonju Prison.\nPreviously, the defendant was ordered to pay a fine of 1.5 million won for driving under the influence, a violation of the Road Traffic Act, in a summary order by the Anyang Branch of the Suwon District Court on June 1, 2012, and received a similar summary order for a fine of 3 million won for the same charge by the Yeongwol Branch of the Chuncheon District Court on June 3, 2013.\n\nCriminal Facts\nAt approximately 04:45 on June 30, 2020, the defendant drove an F Avante sedan from the road in front of C in B, Wonju-si, Gangwon-do, to the road in front of E in the same city while intoxicated with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.169%, covering a distance of approximately 1.4 km.\nIn doing so, the defendant drove a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol despite having a previous record of being punished for drunk driving.\n\nReasons for Sentencing\n[Favorable Circumstances] The defendant is reflecting on his actions concerning this incident. Since being involved in a traffic accident in 2005, the defendant has been suffering from an organic mood disorder and alcohol dependency syndrome.\n[Unfavorable Circumstances] Considering the continuously serious social harm resulting from drunk driving and the change in legal sentiment among the general public, there has been a trend toward intensifying the legal penalties for drunk driving offenses. Therefore, it is necessary to strictly punish such offenses. The defendant has been previously punished four times for drunk driving. The defendant committed the current offense of drunk driving during a repeat offense period.\nTaking into account these circumstances along with the defendant's age, character, family relationships, environment, and other matters presented during the trial of this case, the sentence is determined as indicated in the decision."}

{"doc_id": "5593", "text": "Case Title:\nViolation of the Road Traffic Act (Driving Under the Influence)\n\nJudgment:\nThe defendant is sentenced to one year of imprisonment.\n\nFactual Background:\nCriminal Record:\nThe defendant was fined 5 million KRW by the Gwangju District Court on January 30, 2013, for violating the Road Traffic Act by driving under the influence. On November 24, 2016, the defendant received an eight-month prison sentence with a two-year suspended execution for the same offense, among others. Furthermore, the defendant was sentenced to ten months' imprisonment for drunk driving under the Road Traffic Act by the Gwangju District Court on November 29, 2018. During the execution of the sentence, the defendant was paroled on February 28, 2020, and completed the parole period on March 31, 2020.\n\nCrime Details:\nOn July 8, 2021, around 18:05, the defendant, with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.138%, inebriated, drove a NEW TEE motorcycle from the road in front of C in Buk-gu, Gwangju to the road in front of E in Buk-gu, Gwangju, over an approximate distance of 500 meters.\nBy doing so, the defendant has violated Article 44(1) of the Road Traffic Act on at least two separate occasions.\n\nReasons for Sentencing:\nThe defendant has four previous instances of drunk driving and has twice been sentenced to imprisonment for causing bodily harm while driving under the influence. Despite this, the defendant has chosen to drive while intoxicated again. Considering these circumstances, including the commission of the crime during a repeat offense period, it becomes impossible to issue another suspended sentence. Hence, the selection of a prison term is inevitable.\n\nHowever, certain factors weigh in the defendant’s favor, such as the defendant scrapping the motorcycle used during the incident, the defendant's poor health following heart surgery, and the defendant's admission of wrongdoing. Additionally, considering the defendant's blood alcohol level at the time of the incident, the circumstances leading to the drunk driving, the distance and location of the driving, as well as other factors including the defendant's age, character, and circumstances before and after the crime, as demonstrated by the case records and arguments, the court decides the extent of imprisonment as ordered."}

Thus, the defendant has driven a vehicle while intoxicated on more than two occasions.\n\nReasons for the Sentence\nDespite having multiple previous convictions for similar offenses, and in spite of the enhanced legal standards and statutory penalties aimed at eradicating the dangers of drunk driving, reflecting the public demand of the current Road Traffic Act, the defendant again drove under the influence and damaged a parked vehicle. In addition, there was the use of abusive language towards the arresting police officer, an attempt to flee, and eventual apprehension, and it seems that the driving was carried out taking advantage of the lack of drunk-driving crackdowns during the rapid spread of COVID-19. All these factors make the crime non-negligible and raise concerns about the risk of reoffending, which necessitates a stern warning by choosing a prison term.\nHowever, considering that the defendant's blood alcohol concentration was below the license revocation threshold, there was no prior conviction resulting in imprisonment for a similar crime, the defendant is in severe economic distress, suffering from depression and a spinal disorder making their health poor, and considering the defendant's age and family circumstances, the execution of the sentence is suspended, but probation supervision is ordered, as it is considered that strict management and supervision by a probation officer will help prevent reoffending.\nFor the above reasons, the judgment is rendered as ordered."}

In this incident, the defendant was driving with an extremely high blood alcohol content in a drunken state and caused a traffic accident by colliding with another vehicle, which manifested the general traffic risk associated with drunk driving. This makes the crime rather serious and reprehensible.

These circumstances are unfavorable to the defendant. On the other hand, the defendant has acknowledged the wrongdoings, is deeply remorseful, and vows not to commit the same type of offense. Furthermore, the distance driven while intoxicated was short, the traffic accident caused by the defendant's drunk driving was minor without causing physical harm to the other driver, and apart from the previous fine for drunk driving, the defendant has no other criminal record. Additionally, the defendant's spouse pleads for leniency for the defendant, and the defendant has the responsibility to support a child with disabilities.

However, considering mitigating factors such as the significant time lapse since the defendant's last offense and his remorse, the sentence was reduced accordingly. Within the range of available sentences, the period of imprisonment is decided and its execution is suspended, while also ordering the completion of a lawful driving course, as set forth in the order.

Drunk driving is a dangerous crime that may endanger not only the life of the driver but also that of others, and the blood alcohol concentration level was significant.\nHowever, the defendant showing remorse for their wrongdoing has been considered in their favor. The court has determined the sentence as ordered, considering the defendant's age, character, environment, motive for the offense, means and consequences, and other circumstances following the crime."}

They have pledged not to commit a similar offense again.\nHowever, the seriousness and harm of drunk driving are very grave, and changes in the public's legal sentiment have led to a continuous increase in the legal penalties for DUI offenses. In today's society, where we frequently hear news of innocent lives being lost to drunk driving incidents, it is essential to strictly punish the act of drunk driving itself to prevent the unnecessary sacrifice of innocent citizens. Furthermore, the defendant's blood alcohol content at the time of the offense was significant at 0.144%. The defendant has already been criminally punished three times for drunk driving. Notably, the defendant committed this crime despite receiving a suspended sentence for a drunk driving-related offense in 2016. The defendant re-obtained their driver’s license on December 8, 2020, and committed the crime within less than a month.

The measured blood alcohol content of 0.143% is considerably high. The defendant's driving was hazardous, as evidenced by hitting a guardrail and subsequently being apprehended by the police who responded to the report. The level of risk involved in the defendant's conduct is high. Notwithstanding the fact that the defendant had previously been fined twice for DUI, they once again committed the same offense after approximately one year, heightening the reprehensibility of their actions. Moreover, the defendant has a history of being on probation for a suspended prison sentence for a different kind of offense. Taking these factors into consideration, even though the company's employment rules state that being punished with imprisonment or more severe penalties constitute grounds for dismissal, it is not appropriate to give the defendant another fine as a lenient measure.\nNevertheless, the defendant admits to their wrongdoing and is showing remorse.

Legal range of punishment: 1 year to 2 years and 6 months of imprisonment\n2. Decision on the imposed sentence\n[Unfavorable Factors] The harm caused by drunk driving is severe, and there is a societal consensus that offenders should be punished more severely than before, leading to legal amendments that have raised the statutory penalties. Despite having been punished for drunk driving twice before, the defendant committed the same offense again. The defendant's blood alcohol concentration level was not low. The defendant was involved in an accident where parked vehicles were hit.\n[Favorable Factors] The last drunk driving offense occurred around 2010. The defendant has no prior record of punishment more severe than a fine. Compensation for property damage has been settled and agreed upon. The defendant acknowledges the wrongdoing.\nTaking into account the aforementioned factors, and considering other sentencing factors such as the defendant's age, character, environment, motive of the crime, and circumstances after the crime, as revealed during the trial of this case, the sentence is determined as ordered."}

However, the execution of the sentence is suspended for a period of two years from the date of the finalization of this judgment.

The blood alcohol level at the time of the offense was very high, and considering the defendant hit a bollard and fell asleep at the wheel before being caught for drunk driving, the nature of the crime is poor. These points are taken into consideration in sentencing the defendant to imprisonment.\nNevertheless, the following points have been taken into account: the defendant has confessed and is showing remorse for the offense, the defendant has never received a criminal punishment exceeding a fine, and the defendant has stated to the investigative authorities that \"I drove about 2 meters while waiting for a designated driver to park the car,\" and there is no evidence to suggest such a statement is false. Therefore, considering the actual distance driven under the influence was short, a suspended sentence is given. However, to prevent recidivism, the defendant is ordered to undergo probation and attend 40 hours of law-abiding driving lectures. Other factors such as the defendant's age, character, environment, motives, and circumstances of the crime, as well as circumstances after the crime, have been considered in determining the sentence as ordered."}

Additionally, on September 4, 2015, the defendant was fined 8 million won by the Seoul Central District Court for a Driving Under the Influence charge.\n\nCriminal Offense\nOn April 6, 2021, at approximately 18:55, the defendant drove a Grandeur sedan (vehicle number omitted) while under the influence of alcohol with a blood alcohol content of 0.195%. The incident took place on the road from near C in Songpa-gu, Seoul, to the road in front of D in Songpa-gu, covering a distance of approximately 1 km. By these actions, the defendant violated the prohibition on driving under the influence on more than two occasions.\n\nReasons for the Sentence\nThe current Road Traffic Act stipulates strict punishment for individuals who violate the prohibition on driving under the influence or refusal to submit to a blood alcohol test more than twice, in order to prevent drunk driving and awaken public awareness of its dangers. Drunk driving is a hazardous offense that can harm not only one's own life, but also the lives of others. The defendant had already been punished four times for drunk driving offenses but still committed the crime in question. The significant blood alcohol level and the distance driven while under the influence are aggravating factors.\n\nHowever, the court has considered as mitigating factors that the defendant shows remorse for the wrongdoing, has not had previous drunk driving offenses since around 2015, which is relatively a long time ago, and that long-term imprisonment of the defendant could entail excessive hardship for the dependent family. Taking into account the defendant's age, character, circumstances, motive and means of the offense, outcomes, and behavior after the crime, among other sentencing conditions in their entirety, the sentence is thus determined as stated in the disposition."}

On July 13, 2017, the defendant received a 10-month prison sentence with a 2-year suspension from the Gwangju District Court for the same offense. On November 22, 2018, during the suspension period, the Gwangju District Court sentenced the defendant to 6 months in prison for the same crime, and this sentence became final on November 30, 2018, resulting in the revocation of the previous suspended sentence.

Thus, the defendant has violated Article 44, Paragraph 1 of the Road Traffic Act on more than two occasions.\n\nReasons for the Sentencing\nThe defendant has been criminally punished five times for drunk driving, and despite having served an actual prison term of 6 months handed down by the Gwangju District Court on November 22, 2018, for drunk driving, the defendant again committed the offense during the repeat offense period. The defendant's blood alcohol content was very high at 0.184%, and after colliding with two parked vehicles, the defendant left the scene without taking any measures. Given the defendant's history and frequency of drunk driving convictions, it appears that the defendant significantly lacks the will to abide by the law, which necessitates a strict criminal punishment.\n\nHowever, considering circumstances such as the defendant's admission of guilt and remorseful behavior, the pregnancy of the defendant's spouse, as well as the defendant's age, character and environment, motives, means and consequences of the crime, and circumstances after the crime as revealed during the trial, the sentence is determined as ordered."}

In addition to these, the defendant has an extensive criminal record, and the current offense was committed during the probation period for a separate fixed-term offense. Despite numerous opportunities given to correct behavior, it is difficult to see any change in the defendant’s actions. Given the defendant’s blood alcohol concentration, it is implausible to consider hangover effects from drinking the previous night; even if it were due to a hangover, such a high level makes it difficult to consider in the defendant’s favor.

{"doc_id": "5123", "text": "Case Title\nViolation of the Road Traffic Act (Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol)\n\nRuling\nThe defendant is sentenced to one year in prison.\n\nFacts of the Case\nThe defendant has a previous record of violating the Road Traffic Act (driving under the influence of alcohol), having been notified on June 15, 2017, by the Daejeon District Court of a summary order for a fine of 4,000,000 KRW.\nOn December 2, 2020, at approximately 03:35 AM, the defendant drove a C220 CDI passenger vehicle (license plate number omitted) for about 19 km from the road in front of C in Sejong B to the road in front of D in Yuseong District, Daejeon, with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.109%, while under the influence of alcohol.\nThus, the defendant has violated Article 44, Section 1 of the Road Traffic Act more than twice by driving a vehicle while intoxicated.\nThe defendant claims that the measured blood alcohol concentration was solely due to alcohol consumed after returning home, and therefore, it cannot be conclusively stated that the defendant drove while intoxicated with a blood alcohol concentration above the criminal punishment threshold of 0.03% at the time of driving. Despite this claim and vehement denial of the crime in question, considering the following circumstances as known through evidence lawfully obtained and examined by this court, ① the alcohol test on the defendant took place about 10 minutes after the defendant returned home, in front of the defendant's house, ② the defendant did not tell the police officer who measured the alcohol level that alcohol was consumed at home, and the defendant's spouse, who was present at the time, also testified that the defendant did not drink at home, ③ the defendant alleges that within about 10 minutes of arriving home, a bottle of soju was consumed in two separate instances and that the soju bottle and side dishes were secretly hidden under a wardrobe so they were not discovered at home; these claims are so contrary to common sense and contradict the defendant's other statements and circumstantial evidence that there's no need to refute them. Therefore, the crime as indicated can be sufficiently acknowledged.\n\nReasons for Sentencing\nDrunk driving is a serious crime that can cause significant harm to the lives, bodies, and property of innocent people; hence, it is essential that the defendant be held accountable by imposing a punishment that corresponds to the gravity of the act. Despite having a prior record of being punished for drunk driving around 2017, the defendant committed the same offense again. The defendant's blood alcohol concentration at the time of the offense was substantially high, and a traffic accident resulted from the defendant hitting a curb while driving. Although the crime is undeniably acknowledged, the defendant continues to repeat baseless lies without showing any remorse for the wrongdoing, indicating the defendant has a low sense of law-abiding behavior and ethics, and there is a considerable risk of recidivism. These factors necessitate a custodial sentence for the defendant.\nHowever, considering specifically that the defendant has no prior record of being punished with a prison term, as well as considering the defendant’s age, behavior, environment, the motives, means and consequences of the offense, and the circumstances after the crime, as revealed in the case records and during the trial, the court has determined the sentence as ordered."}

Thus, the defendant, who committed this act, must bear strict legal responsibility corresponding to the offense. Despite having been punished twice for drunk driving previously, the defendant repeated the offense. At the time of the crime, the defendant's blood alcohol concentration was substantially high. Additionally, taking into account the defendant's age, character, circumstances, the motive and means of the offense, the results, and the situation after the offense as indicated in the case records and during the trial, the court has determined the sentence as ordered above."}

It is unmistakable that the defendant's sense of law-abiding citizenship is weak. This incident occurred just over a year after the expiration of a suspended prison sentence for unlicensed driving.\n○ The sentence takes into consideration that no traffic accident occurred, the defendant's blood alcohol concentration at the time of drunk driving (0.08%), and the defendant's sincere reflection on their wrongdoing."}

Moreover, the defendant's blood alcohol level at the time of the offense was not low. Therefore, the imposition of a prison sentence on the defendant is unavoidable.\nIn determining the specific sentence, the court considered both the aforementioned disadvantageous factors to the defendant and the favorable aspects, such as the defendant’s confession and display of remorse, as well as the fact that aside from the previous criminal records, the defendant appears to have dedicated to the community and lived without criminal punishment for a substantial period. Taking these points into consideration alongside the defendant's age, family relationships, and circumstances after the offense, the court has determined the sentence as ordered above.\nFor the reasons stated above, the court renders the verdict as ordered."}

The journey started from the underground parking lot of the defendant's residence in B, Gangdong-gu, Seoul and ended at the 81 km point towards Gangneung on the Yeongdong Expressway in Bubal-eup, Icheon, stretching approximately 60 km. Therefore, the Defendant has violated the road traffic regulations prohibiting drunk driving on more than two occasions.\n\nReasons for Sentence:\n○ Aggravating Factors: Drunk driving increases the likelihood of traffic accidents, posing a danger not only to oneself but also potentially causing unforeseen tragedies to others' lives and families. Furthermore, the defendant has a record of six previous fines for similar offenses.\n○ Mitigating Factors: The defendant has acknowledged and reflected on their wrongdoing, and approximately 9 years have passed since the last instance of driving under the influence.\n○ Additional Factors: Other sentencing conditions presented during the trial, including the defendant's age, character, motives for the offense, means and results of the crime, and circumstances after the crime, have been considered."}

The defendant initially falsely claimed during the investigation that it was a cohabitant, not themselves, who had driven the car.\n[Favorable circumstances] The distance driven while under the influence of alcohol was not long, as it was to park the vehicle, and the damage to property appears to be minor. The defendant's previous drunk driving offense occurred around the year 2009, and the defendant has no prior history of punishment more severe than a fine.\nTaking into account the above circumstances, as well as the defendant's age, character, environment, motives for the crime, and the circumstances after the crime, as revealed during the trial's proceedings, the sentence is determined as ordered above."}

The defendant's statements regarding the distance driven during the apprehension and afterwards have been inconsistent, so it does not appear that the driving was only for a short distance. Therefore, the Court finds it inevitable to impose an actual term of imprisonment. However, no accident occurred during the commission of the offense, and numerous acquaintances are petitioning for leniency for the defendant, indicating that the defendant seems to have strong social ties; these points have been considered to mitigate the sentence to the minimum extent.
